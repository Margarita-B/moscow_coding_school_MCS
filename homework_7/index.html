							<p class="comment">“.. I was NOT disappointed with the performance. The massive Air Unit at the heel combined with the dual density foam on the midsole and the cushioning of the insole delivered a surprisingly comfortable stride. This shoe is not a gimmick folks. It’s the real deal.”</p>

							<p class="comment">“.. Nike went all out with this model and finally answered our prayers by making this model a full lifestyle sneaker. This shoe isn’t made for the super runner or made for your Nike+ Apple Watch. This model is made for that lifestyle sneakerhead who wants that everyday comfort and can rock this shoe with almost anything. Nike will be releasing several colorways to kick off this new release by featuring a “hot punch, photo blue, volt, and total orange.”</p>

							<p class="comment">“.. Overall, this is a simple sneaker you’ll want to kick it in all the time. Some sneakers are so expensive or so good looking that you barely want to wear them. The Air Max 270 sits in a sweet spot where you wouldn’t get upset by some accidental dirt because they’re pretty easy to clean, yet it’s good enough looking to put some fire fits together and break some necks because of that bold airbag.”</p>
