						<p class="description">Drawing on a restaurant tablecloth in Chicago's Johnny Ricketts restaurant, sports promoter Leo A. Seltzer, came up with the idea of a roller marathon in the spring of 1935. <br>
						By early August, 50 skaters had been selected to compete in 25 male-female teams. The first Transcontinental Roller Derby opened at noon on August 13, 1935. Twenty thousand Chicagoans filled the air-conditioned Chicago Coliseum to witness the 25 teams skate 3,000 miles around the track, a distance equal to that between San Diego and New York City. The winners would be the team to cover that distance in the shortest time. <br>
						Each team had to travel a given number of miles in every 11 1/2 hour daily skating session. During the entire time allotted for the race, one of the two members had to skate or else the team risked disqualification</p>
						<p class="description">In 1937, changes in the sport suggested by sportswriter Damon Runyon, increased the level of physical contact between the skaters. <br>
						The roller derby evolved from an endurance race among several teams to one in which two teams of five players earned points by successfully circling the track and passing a member of the rival team at the end of the pack. With a certain roughness now permitted, skaters began pushing and shoving with gusto; though largely exaggerated, physical activity and violence became hallmarks of the derby.</p>

						<p class="description">Modern roller derby is an international sport dominated by all-female amateur teams, in addition to a growing number of male, unisex, and junior roller derby teams, and was (as a roller sport) under consideration for the 2020 Summer Olympics. FIRS recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the official international governing body for all things roller sports, has released its first set of Roller Derby Rules, which will be used in the World Roller Games, taking place September 2017 in Nanjing, China. Most modern leagues (their back-office volunteers included) share a strong "do it yourself" ethic[10] which combines athleticism and elements from camp. As of 2018, the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), had 423 full member leagues and 46 Apprentice Leagues.</p>
						<p class="description">Since 2006, the WFTDA has sponsored an annual championship. In 2008 this first took the modern form of the "Big 5": four regional playoffs, and a final championship tournament. The association also officially recognizes eligible tournaments hosted by member leagues. E.g., the annual SpudTown Knockdown, which is held in Boise, Idaho beforehand, is "the Best of the Rest of the West." The first Roller Derby World Cup, an international competition, took place in Toronto, Canada, in December 2011. The second World Cup took place in Dallas, Texas, in December 2014. Since 2012, USARS has held an annual Roller Derby National Championship. In 2017 USARS will be recognized by the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and participate in the 2017 FIRS Roller Games Roller Derby World Championship in Nanjing China.</p>
