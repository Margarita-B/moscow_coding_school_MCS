						<p>Just like a cowboy in a western, your “trigger” fingers start itching. You get a healthy buzz from the endless possibilities that await you – you’re inspired by that one amazing idea. <br>
						Let’s face it – you know you’re going to drop any and all plans and dive into this project with every drop of energy at your disposal. You’re going to be up all day and all night. <br>
						Sooner or later, you snap, drop everything, and start coding this exciting new idea into reality – one line at a time. <br>
						Most of the time, this burst of motivation is a good thing. It catalyzes action like a drop of nitro inside your fuel tank. You feel hyper-focused and complete tasks at lightning speed.
						However, you sometimes get excited about things that aren’t priorities. You chase tangents. In all your excitement, you find it difficult to satisfy your curiosity about solving this problem.

						<p>In The Social Network, Justin Timberlake’s character tries to greet a group of hackers. The Zuckerberg character says, “Don’t bother greeting, they are in the zone.” <br>
						Sometimes, you get the ball rolling so fast that everything else becomes a blip on the horizon. You put off your lunch break for hours. Your eyeballs start to turn yellow because you can’t stop—not even for a minute—to visit the restroom. <br>
						You code and code and code. With every code execution and every error, you feel the solution waiting for you – right around the corner. <br>
						“If I just fix this error, I can commit and take a break.”Sound familiar? Does the voice in your head keep you going… to fix… just one more… bug? <br>
						This phase can go on for a full workday. After work, you feel hungry and tired, but happy. You’ve slayed yet another “bug monster” or reached the summit of one more “feature mountain.”

						<p>From time to time, you have epiphanies. <br>
						You discover a new technology or a better way of doing something. You feel eager and excited. You know this is exactly what you need to make your code faster, cleaner, and more optimized. You feel pumped up and dig in hard. <br>
						However, this phase often doesn’t end well. <br>
						Your great idea wasn’t necessarily a bad one. But, the thought that this was just a minor adjustment goes out of the window. After a week of refactoring, you realize one of two things: 
						<ol class="links">
							<li>This is too big of a piece of cake to eat all in one go. OR</li>
							<li>This idea just isn’t working out with the current codebase.</li>
						</ol>
						However, these solutions sometimes work out. Your miracle really does everything you imagined it would. It’s a gamble, but refactoring failures are totally worth the feeling you get when your dreams really do come true.</p>
